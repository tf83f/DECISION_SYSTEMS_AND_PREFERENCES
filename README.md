# DECISION_SYSTEMS_AND_PREFERENCES

The problem under study is a staff planning and project assignment problem (see subject).

The project has two parts (see report): 
  - The first part consists in developing and, implementing a model allowing to calculate the surface of the non-dominated solutions of the multiobjective optimization problem. 
  - The second part aims to develop a preference model allowing to discriminate between the solutions of the surface of the non-dominated solutions.
